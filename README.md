# modern-xmin

An eXtremely minimal goHugo theme inspired by [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) and updated for the post-v0.146.0 layout system.

I always found the original hugo-xmin theme perfect for debugging new shortcodes or testing new goHugo features isolated from the complexity of my bigger projects. In that spirit, this repo does not add any new features but will try to maintain compatibility with the latest gohugo version
